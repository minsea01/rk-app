# COCO 10-class subset for RK3588 edge deployment
# Focused on high-value urban/industrial surveillance classes

# Usage:
#   yolo detect train model=yolov8n.pt data=datasets/coco_10class.yaml \
#     imgsz=416 epochs=100 batch=64 freeze=10 amp=True
#
# Original COCO IDs -> contiguous 0-9 mapping is handled by Ultralytics
# when 'classes' filter is NOT used (we define our own dataset yaml instead).
